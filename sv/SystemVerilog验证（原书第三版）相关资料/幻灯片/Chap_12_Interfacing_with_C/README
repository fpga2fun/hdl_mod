Note that unlike for Chapters 1-11, Chapter 12 has a set of very simple exercises 
for the slides and a set of exercises more appropriate for homework exercises. The 
homework exercises are the exercises listed at the end of Chapter 12.  The book
exercises are numbered exercise1 through exercise10. The slides exercises are 
numbered exercise1_slide through exercise6_slide.
